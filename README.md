<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p><h4 align="center">I'm Solja, a junior developer and career shifter with a background in journalism. Shifting gears, I embraced a new challenge by completing an intensive program in Java programming, AWS and GCP in early 2023.</h4></p>

<p><h4 align="center">Since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my technical skill set, delving into both front-end technologies (React, JavaScript & TypeScript) and back-end technologies (Python).</h4></p>

- ðŸ”­ Currently I'm a trainee at [Softlandia](https://softlandia.fi/), contributing to projects in both back-end and front-end, including the generative AI solution [Yokot.ai](https://yokot.ai/). This has deepened my understanding and interest in LLM-powered applications and creating effective user interfaces.
