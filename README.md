<p><align="center">I'm Solja, a junior developer and career shifter with a background in journalism. Shifting gears, I embraced a new challenge by completing an intensive program in Java programming, AWS and GCP in early 2023.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my technical skill set. Working in Futurice's managed services since 2024, I get to to tackle multiple projects and a highly versatile tech stack on a day-to-day basis (Node.js. .NET, Spring Boot in backend, React and Typescript in frontend, PostgreSQL and GCP to name a few of the main ones).</p>
